# cleanbeautyapp

Scraped product data from Sephoraâ€™s website using Puppeteer and seeded a PostgreSQL database via CSV.

Designed RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express for seamless frontend-backend communication.

Implemented secure user authentication using bcrypt for password hashing and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session management.

Utilized Redux for state management and CSS Flexbox for responsive, modern UI design.

Enabled users to evaluate product ingredients and determine if they align with organic/natural standards.
